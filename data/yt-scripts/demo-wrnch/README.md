# wrnchAI Cloud API Python Code Sample

This code sample demonstrates some of the methods (mainly in `api.py`) to interact with the wrnchAI Cloud API Python wrapper. Before testing it, please make sure you have the Python module `wrcloud` available in your working environment. Installation instructions and API documentation can be accessed at:

```

### Installation Requirements

Dependencies required by this code sample are listed in `requirements.txt`. Run the following command to install them:

```shellscript
$ pip3 install -r <path-to-requirements.txt>
```

The demo app requires the GUI tool [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html). In Windows 10 or Mac OS, Tkinter is included with the core Python. If you use Linux, you need to install it separately.

```shellscript
$ sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

Once you have all the dependencies ready, launch the app by:

```shellscript
$ python3 <path-to-ui.py>
```
